\subsection{Problem 14}

Consider the following commutative diagram:

	\begin{tikzcd}
		& M'  \arrow[r,"\phi_1"] \arrow[d,"f" ]  & M \arrow[r,"\phi_2"] \arrow[d, "g"]& M'' \arrow[r] \arrow[d,"h"] & 0 \\
0	\arrow[r] & N'	\arrow[r,"\psi_1"] & N \arrow[r,"\psi_2"] & N''	
	\end{tikzcd}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let us prove that if $f,h$ are monomorphisms, then $g$ is also a monomorphism. It suffices to show that if $g(x) = 0_N$, then $x = 0_M$. Since $h$ is a monomorphism, $\ker h = \{0_{M''}\}$. Thus, by the exactness of the top row and commutativity of the rightmost square, $x \in \text{img }\phi_1 \cap \ker{g}$. Since $x \in \text{img }\phi_1$, there exists $a \in M'$ such that $\phi(a) = x$. By commutativity of the leftmost square, $\psi(f(a)) = 0_N$. However, $f$ is a monomorphism and so is $\psi_1$ by the exactness of the bottom row. Hence, $a = 0_{M'}$ and $x = \phi_1(a) = 0_M$
	\end{enumerate}
